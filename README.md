# üöó Lusty94 Vehicle Images

- This repository contains remote vehicle images used in ``lusty94_rental``
- These images are served directly via raw GitHub URLs to support dynamic vehicle rental menus and other features.




## üîß How to Use

- In your config file for lusty94_rental, reference the vehicle image like this:

```lua
vehicles = {
  [1] = { 
      model = 'asbo', -- vehicle spawn name
      label = 'Asbo', -- label for menu
      description = 'Small, nimble and reliable!', -- description for menu
      price = 100, -- price to rent vehicle per minute
      image = 'asbo.png', -- vehicle image name on github link
      requiredTier = 0, -- 0 = no membership required
  },
}
```

The script will then fetch the image from:
